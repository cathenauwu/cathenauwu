- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @cathenauwu
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in development, rockets, running, and playing minecraft
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™ve been continuously learning bits of java, c++, html, python, and more over the years. I mainly use Linux, preferably some version of Debian. (I'm 15 so I don't have a ton of experience)
- I'm currently trying to learn to develop Java plugins...
